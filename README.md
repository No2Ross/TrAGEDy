# TrAGEDy
Trajectory Alignment of Gene Expression Dynamics

# Introduction
While the study of an organism or biological process by itself is important, understanding the effect of the environment or conditions on an organism or biological process is also critical. Whether this be genetic, nutrient, environmental or disease conditions; understanding what genes define the differences across these conditions can help us better understand the underlying process/organism in general. 

Using TrAGEDy we can find the common alignment between the two conditions, identifying what cells are undergoing a similar biological process bewteen the two conditions.

TrAGEDy can then arrange the cells on a common pseudotime axis in order to pull out genes which are differentially expressed between the conditions at different points in the shared process.
